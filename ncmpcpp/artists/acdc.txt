AC/DC is an Australian rock band formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in December 1973 by Angus and Malcom Young. Their albums have sold in colossal numbers; the total is now estimated at well over 200 million copies worldwide, with the 1980 album Back In Black selling over 21 million in the US alone and 40+ million worldwide, making it according to statistics the best selling album in the world ever released by a band. Their newest album released in 2008 entitled Black Ice is critically acclaimed even ahead of its release. The band has had two distinctive lead singers, and fans tend to divide its history into the "Bon Scott era (1974-80)" and the "Brian Johnson era (1980-present)".

Most fans will agree that lead guitarist Angus Young is the face of AC/DC, appearing on the cover of most albums. His wild stage antics and schoolboy uniform have made him one of the most loved guitar players of all time. He has the unparalleled ability to captivate an audience of over 50,000 people with just the sounds of his guitar and his facial expressions. Most footage of Angus consists of him either doing Chuck Berry's patented Duck Walk across the stage, or of his mop of hair flying around as he rocks through one of his famous solos. Aside from captivating solos, he has also created some of the most well-known riffs together with his brother Malcolm Young (who is the man behind the "Back In Black" riff, by the way).

Bon Scott was the second man to front AC/DC back in 1973( Dave Evans was the first). He would always smile when he was singing and often made a sideways glance towards a camera if it was there with a grin on his face. Also known for wearing a School Girl outfit with pigtails and smoking a cigarette on their first TV performance, with his duties as lead vocalist, Scott also helped to write many of the band's most popular songs. He was lyrically at his best on such songs as "Let There Be Rock" and "Shot Down in Flames". Sadly, Bon died February 19th 1980 due to alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking in London. It was around this time that AC/DC were starting to get global recognition.

The rhythm section of AC/DC includes Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), Cliff Williams (bass) and Phil Rudd (drums). Other drummers include Simon Wright ('82-'88) and Chris Slade ('89-'94).

Brian Johnson (earlier in British rock band Geordie) became the new front man of AC/DC in early 1980 after Bon Scott passed away. Brian is known for always wearing his paperboy cap, a black tank top and blue jeans. He is noted for his distinctive, rough and jagged, yet powerful falsetto style of singing, with a remarkably high range. Well known examples for Johnson's characteristic vocals are found in the songs "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)" and "You Shook Me All Night Long". With blessings from the Scott family, Brian has been singing his way into fans' hearts for over 25 years.
